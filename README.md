# Diffie-Hellman
This repository hosts a Python script that focuses on generating cryptographic primes and performing modular exponentiation, which are fundamental operations in various cryptographic algorithms, including public-key cryptosystems.

Features
Prime Generation: Utilizes sympy.randprime() to generate large prime numbers suitable for cryptographic use, ensuring they meet specific criteria such as being a safe prime.
Modular Exponentiation: Implements a custom function to perform modular exponentiation, which is a critical operation in many cryptographic protocols to efficiently compute powers modulo a prime number.
Security-Driven Design: The script is designed to handle large integers and perform computations that are essential for secure cryptographic operations.
